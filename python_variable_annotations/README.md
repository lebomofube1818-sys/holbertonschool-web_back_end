# Python - Variable Annotations

## Project Overview

This project introduces **type annotations** in Python 3.9. It focuses on
writing functions and variables using explicit type hints to improve code
readability, maintainability, and static type checking.

Type annotations help developers understand what type of data a function
expects and what it returns, without having to read the full implementation.
They also allow static analysis tools to detect potential type-related errors
before runtime.

By completing this project, you should be able to explain:

- What type annotations are in Python
- How to use type hints for variables
- How to annotate function parameters and return types
- How to use built-in types in annotations
- The importance of type checking in large codebases
- How annotations improve documentation and code clarity
