# Python Async Functions

## Project Overview

This project explores **asynchronous programming in Python** using `asyncio` and coroutines. 
Each task demonstrates the fundamentals of async operations, random delays, and proper type 
annotations with fully documented modules and functions. 

## Requirements

- Python 3.9
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Pycodestyle 2.5.x
- Files must be executable and end with a newline
- All functions and coroutines are type-annotated
- Proper module and function docstrings
